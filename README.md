# edge
Edge is a recon tool focused on exploring cloud service providers.  Can be used for pentesting, bug bounty, red teaming, or R&D of cloud providers.  Edge automatically loads CSP IP prefixes (AWS, Azure, GCP) and can do prefix lookups based on IP addressing.

This tool was inspired from many other tools and authors, including dnsrecon and gobuster.  Not a lot new here other than combining IP prefix CSP lookups.  Just wanted to learn Golang.
