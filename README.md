# edge
Edge is a recon tool focused on exploring cloud service providers.  Can be used for pentesting, bug bounty, red teaming, or R&D of cloud providers.  Edge automatically loads CSP IP prefixes (AWS, Azure, GCP) and can do prefix lookups based on IP addressing.

# Detailed Usage / Examples
```edge -domain <domain> -dns -crt -prefix -wordlist <wordlist.txt>``` : Do a wordlist scan of all A and CNAME records based on wordlist.txt against domain with certificate transparency lookup.  For each enumerated host found with Cert transparency, also do a DNS lookup.  Do an IP prefix lookup of the IP address.

```edge -domain <domain> -dns -wordlist <wordlist.txt>```:  Perform just a wordlist scan of all A and CNAME records based on wordlist.

```edge -domain <domain> -crt```:  Do a Certificate Transparency log lookup using https://crt.sh

```edge -domain <domain> -dns -crt```:  Do a Certificate transparency lookup.  For each host discovered via Cert Transparency, do a full DNS A or CNAME lookup.

This tool was inspired from many other tools and authors, including dnsrecon and gobuster.  Not a lot new here other than combining IP prefix CSP lookups.  Just wanted to learn Golang.
